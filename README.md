# Tool info
Shell4j, is a simple log4j vulnerabilities scanner that will prompt the user to enter a URL, and will then fetch the contents of the URL and search for specific strings that are associated with different types of log4j vulnerabilities. If one of these strings is found, the script outputs a message indicating that a vulnerability has been detected, along with some general guidance on how to exploit the vulnerability. If none of these strings are found, the script outputs a message indicating that no vulnerabilities were detected.

Disclaimer: Note that this script is a basic example and may not detect all log4j vulnerabilities. You may want to modify the script or use additional tools to perform more thorough testing. Additionally, it is important to remember that it is not appropriate to exploit vulnerabilities, even for testing purposes. It is important to focus on detecting and fixing vulnerabilities to ensure the security and stability of systems.
